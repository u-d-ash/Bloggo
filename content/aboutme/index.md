hey there !\
it feels nice to know that someone is curious about me :) *(or maybe you just wanted to see whether this guy has completed the website or not)*\
\
my name is udit jethva, a mathematics sophomore at iit guwahati\
i **struggle** in my academics so i find solace in my hobbies

##### My Hobbies
* **unpursued hobbies** : doodling, reading novels
* **pursued hobbies** : playing tennis, listening music
* **partially pursued** : quizzing, solving puzzles, writing, watching movies

(i know it's cliche but ... can't sway from the truth)

**fun fact : people have also accused me of multi-personality disorder (and they maybe right x_x )**

expect cool random sh*t in my blog posts (they may be nerdy at times, don't blame me !)

fin.
