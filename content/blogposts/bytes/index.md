**F1 is sick !** Yeah, even I am now part of the bandwagon of mad people enjoying "superfast cars going around in circles". To be honest, that was what I thought about the sport earlier and I guess everyone off the grid shares the same notion. But we (F1 followers) know that the reality speaks different.
\
\
I just spent 90 minutes of my Sunday morning watching the Australian GP and boy was it not worth it. Verstappen retiring in 3rd Lap, both the Mercedes' crashing out, Sainz getting P1 after recovering from an apendicitis operation. . . Now, I am seriously looking forward to the next races.

\
I am just new to the game so haven't really picked a side to be loyal to but I guess I will be rooting for Ferrari this season. I hate it when a single player dominates the sport *(The Joker, iykyk)*

Tomorrow is my Real Analysis midsem which is 25% of my grade and am seriously under prepared. Probably not the best time to write on your blog but here I am. It seems that I am the worst when it comes to sorting one's priorities.\
\
Maybe, the reason of this is the fact that I have to study "real analysis". I have a love-hate relationship with pure mathematics. I mean I seriously enjoyed the lectures we had (though I didn't get half of what the prof was talking about) because they were mentally stimulating and fascinating at times, but I guess the abstract nature of the subject is not my thing.\
\
**My bad**.\
\
As of now, looks like the second cipher of the semester is on my way **;)**
