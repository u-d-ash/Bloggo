Tomorrow is my Real Analysis midsem which is 25% of my grade and am seriously under prepared. Probably not the best time to write on your blog but here I am. It seems that I am the worst when it comes to sorting one's priorities.\
\
Maybe, the reason of this is the fact that I have to study "real analysis". I have a love-hate relationship with pure mathematics. I mean I seriously enjoyed the lectures we had (though I didn't get half of what the prof was talking about) because they were mentally stimulating and fascinating at times, but I guess the abstract nature of the subject is not my thing.\
\
**My bad**.\

As of now, looks like the second cipher of the semester is on my way **;)**
