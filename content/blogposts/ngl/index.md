> You must let go of your fear of being cringe in order to be free - Master Oogway

First of all, I didn't really expect these many questions to pop up in that inbox because personally, I never really cared about these 'ngl stories' and ignored them.\
\
*Many of you did just that, so, **congratulations!**, you are a sensible individual*

For the people who posted :

**Thank you, you are awesome, is bakch*di me mera saath dene ke liye dhanyawaad !**

The questions I received can be divided into 4 broad categories:

* Queries about my college academics
* Queries about my relationship status
* bore
* generic sh*t

I will try and answer **all** of these in a fluid manner.

Many of you wanted this, so here it is :
> #### My CPI (2 Sems) : 8.53
> #### Projected CPI (3 Sems) : 8.20 - 8.57
**You may leave now.**

I am going to be honest over here. **I struggle in my academics. I find it challenging**. Things can be challenging in two ways :
* Solve this math puzzle | Memorise Laplace transforms
* Solve this CP problem | Write code for a priority queue
* Run 5k in 30 mins | Go get milk from the nearby store

I don't know how some people got the notion that I don't score well because they think 'I don't care about my CPI'

> Fact : I care about my CPI (atleast used to)

But, as I explained above, I don't feel like putting in the efforts because the pull I get towards the subjects is completely out of fear *(of low marks)* rather than fun.

I came to the third semester with a ton of motivation because this time, the courses were *(supposed to be)* interesting. I also put in a lot of effort this time but my `result/effort` ratio was woeful and I slacked off towards the end.

Also I want to rant about the useless profs we got this time who made interesting stuff like Data Structures and Probability boring. And guess what, they are returning in 4th sem **(x _ x)**

#### "Bandi pati?" , "Do you like any girl", "Any crushes ?", etc.

My reply to the equivalence class of these questions:

> I used to like a girl. Now, I don't like any. \
> The number '1' is scared of my singleness\
> My DMs are open to girls who can spell **Massachusetts** correctly !

There was also someone, who wanted to ask about ML and stuff. Buddy, though this article is written with 'monospace', I am not discussing it here. Maybe in another blog post ?!

Someone was like, *yeh faltu kaam karne ka motivation kaha se aata hai?*\
\
As you can see, I just wanted to test out my blog site and needed some content for the first post.

#### Cheesy One Line Q/A:

* **Last girl you texted** : Instagram user
* **Last thing asked to ChatGPT** : give me a single word which means "not returning the borrowed money"
* **Last novel** : 13 Reasons Why
* **Secret I kept from my parents** : Half of my life

I obviously filtered out all the generic questions, which would've made the post long and boring (just like the movies these days)

Ciao.
