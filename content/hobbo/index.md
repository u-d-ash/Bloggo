### quizzing

Quiz Club was the first society I joined after I got into IIT Guwahati. I had a short stint as a designer in first year but am mostly an active member and quizmaster these days. Hope to represent the institute in the upcoming Cult Meet at Patna. Here are my sets: 

* [**Sci-Echo**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18j5jqIeLl_HXojF1OVJeD0hCZNyreKg_/view) : My very first quiz, co-hosted with Shreyans. 
* **No Gene for Fate** : Going to host another SciBizTech with Prakhar and Divyam this semester.
* **Athleticism** : Will host my very first solo quiz this January as a part of Kriti'25.

### doodling

I am hoping to get better at this. You know, make something sensible...

### a few other things

 > Not a buff, but good movies do get me going to the theatres once in a while and I can binge shows over a weekend. 

 > Roger Federer is the GOAT. Nadal comes close second. Let's avoid talking about the third one. 

 > I fw RCB fans after I started supporting Ferrari in Formula 1. 
 
 > Trying to revive my dead reading habit, someone's CPR required. May I Slytherin-to your mind?
