<p>
This amazing Netflix interactive called life. Yeah, I might be sounding a bit of a philosopher with this one but I guess one does need these kinds of "mindpours" from time to time. <i>(Especially when you don't drink)</i>
</p>

<p>
What if you had a rewind button. At times, my soul goes on pondering about the road not taken. The what ifs?. 
</p>

<p>
<b>"Things could've been so much different"</b>
</p>

<p>
But I guess this is what makes one feel alive. This uncertainity is what makes life worth living. Yes, we may regret some of our decisions made in the past but then that is what makes us, us. Those mistakes are not inkblots but beautiful strokes on the canvas of your character.
</p>

The painting is taking shape, let the artist go wild !

<p>
It feels so great to be back on the tennis court. After a period of dormant three months, my racquet was finally out of the cover. 
</p>
<p>
The internship season had driven me crazy. My entire summer was spent in front of the screen, either of TV or my laptop. Ahmedabad heat restricted my outings to a few. I was not able to get together with my friends until the very last day, that too with an excuse of giving a company's test together <i>(we didn't cheat)</i>.
</p>
<p>
After numerous tests, 1 waitlist and 3 shortlists, I finally made it to the other side (the sorted side). 
</p>
<p>
"Your game looks really rusty", said the newly joined fresher. My shots were going anywhere but within the lines; even launched one over the newly installed meshes. I was pissed with my game, but was extemely grateful about the opportunity to play after such a long time.
</p>

Made me realise that we, humans, take so many little things for granted.

Just finished watching Love, Death + Robots on Netflix. Here is the first tierlist I ever made in my life <i>(because why not ;D)</i>
</p>

Not the best use of your summer break time but I was not able to help it...

{{< spoiler prompt = "F1 is sick ...">}}
<p>
<b>F1 is sick !</b> Yeah, even I am now part of the bandwagon of mad people enjoying “superfast cars going around in circles”. To be honest, that was what I thought about the sport earlier and I guess everyone off the grid shares the same notion. But we (F1 followers) know that the reality speaks different.
</p>
<p>
I just spent 90 minutes of my Sunday morning watching the Australian GP and boy was it not worth it. Verstappen retiring in 3rd Lap, both the Mercedes’ crashing out, Sainz getting P1 after recovering from an apendicitis operation. . . Now, I am seriously looking forward to the next races.
</p>

I am just new to the game so haven’t really picked a side to be loyal to but I guess I will be rooting for Ferrari this season. I hate it when a single player dominates the sport (The Joker, iykyk)

{{< spoiler prompt = "Tomorrow is my Real Analysis midsem ...">}}
<p>
Tomorrow is my Real Analysis midsem which is 25% of my grade and am seriously under prepared. Probably not the best time to write on your blog but here I am. It seems that I am the worst when it comes to sorting one’s priorities.
</p>
<p>
Maybe, the reason of this is the fact that I have to study “real analysis”. I have a love-hate relationship with pure mathematics. I mean I seriously enjoyed the lectures we had (though I didn’t get half of what the prof was talking about) because they were mentally stimulating and fascinating at times, but I guess the abstract nature of the subject is not my thing.
</p>
<p>
<b>My bad.</b>
</p>
As of now, looks like the second cipher of the semester is on my way ;)
