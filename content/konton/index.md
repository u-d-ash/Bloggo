### tidbits of my life

{{< spoiler prompt = "I write this while I ...">}}

<p>
I write this while I lay in my sheet-less bed, snuggled well in my blankets. You would've surely played one of those endless runner mobile games like Subway Surfers or Temple Run. For the past 20-30 days, I've been feeling like one of those characters, just running ahead with no one actually chasing.
<p>

<p>
Now, it's not like I've got nothing to do. I want to do a lot of things (by lot, I mean a lottt). Want to read and finish a bunch of novels. Want to read a lot about quantum computation, cryptography, fractals and revive my long dormant blog. 
<p>

<p>
However, I just find myself tired and busy playing online blitz chess (I am horrible at it), solving online puzzles, binging shows or the worst of all : doomscrolling. I used to waste time before as well but these days, that's the only thing I am engaged in. Productivity = @|0|@.
<p>

<p>
I find it difficult to find reasons for this mushy phase. Maybe I am just being lazy (like a bear during winters). Maybe because I am approaching the end of my undergraduate life (only 10 more months on this campus) and need a breath of fresh air. Or maybe because the tennis courts are closed...

<h4> 04/01, 1948 hrs </h4>

{{< spoiler prompt = "Well the new year ...">}}

<p>
Well the new year literally started with WTF (atleast for me). I seriously hope that you had a "happy" new year.
<p>

<p>
"Bhai aaj ka kya plan hai?" was bounced around our hostel with no one actually taking charge and it finally led us to spending the last few hours of 2024 watching the movie "Agent Sai Srinivas Atreya" online while stuffing burgers. All of us, sober.
<p>

<p>
The next few days were not that great. The semester hadn't started in full swing and I just passed time doing nothing before I got hit with my seasonal bronchitis. I tried playing tennis but was gassed out in mere 30 minutes. A choking muscular grip tightened my lungs. My mouth wide open taking critical puffs of humid air in. I was down with my lungs sirening a rhythmic roar.
<p>

<p>
I relied on a cocktail of syrups to improve my condition but that only helped me doze off during afternoons and I was left coughing at midnight. It got worse; a single flight of stairs was now enough to bring me to knees. I finally got a necessary dose of nebulization and am following a strict prescription. Hope to recover soon.
<p>

<p>
Watching the third movie of the new year tonight...

{{< spoiler prompt = "With this, the 2024 ...">}}
<p>
With this, the 2024 Formula 1 season comes to an end. :')
<p>

<p>
Supporting the Scuderia was one heck of an experience, and I look forward to more of the "Holy Shit!", "Damn it!!", "WTF", "Let's fucking go!" weekends and contemplating my life choices every now and then.
</p>

<p>
We were left just a few points shy of the championship and it does hurt a bit. Leclerc pulled an absolute masterclass in Abu Dhabi and I really want that man to take the Drivers' championship next year. With Lewis coming in, even Contructors' can be ours. I feel sad for Carlos. Him being the P1 of the very first race I watched would always keep him in a special place for me. I wish him the very best of time in Williams (secretly want him to pull an Alain Prost).
</p>

Well, the F1 lore continues. March awaits.

<b>"Woh engineering hi kya jisme back na lage !!"</b>
<p>

<p>
Memes like these show up on your Instagram feed. You chuckle a bit, or maybe not, and scroll away with peace, thinking, <i
>this won't happen to me</i>. Well, that aged like milk for me.
</p>

<p>
I am on the verge of failing a course this semester. I wrote the final today and for the first time ever, I am unsure of passing a course. There have been courses in previous semesters in which my performance was pitiful but never have I ever been shit scared like I am at the moment. To add to my woes, the supplementary exams are scheduled during the Inter IIT Cultural Meet in which I am supposed to participate in the quizzing event. 
</p>

<p>
So what went wrong? In retrospect, I feel that I understood the subject matter well but didn't study before exams and was horrible in execution during tests. 
</p>

My friends believe in me though. Tanush offered me to hedge on my final grade. I hope I lose my money.

{{< spoiler prompt = "This amazing Netflix interactive called ...">}}

<p>
This amazing Netflix interactive called life. Yeah, I might be sounding a bit of a philosopher with this one but I guess one does need these kinds of "mindpours" from time to time. <i>(Especially when you don't drink)</i>
</p>

<p>
What if you had a rewind button. At times, my soul goes on pondering about the road not taken. The what ifs?. 
</p>

<p>
<b>"Things could've been so much different"</b>
</p>

<p>
But I guess this is what makes one feel alive. This uncertainity is what makes life worth living. Yes, we may regret some of our decisions made in the past but then that is what makes us, us. Those mistakes are not inkblots but beautiful strokes on the canvas of your character.
</p>

The painting is taking shape, let the artist go wild !

{{< spoiler prompt = "It feels so great ...">}}

<p>
It feels so great to be back on the tennis court. After a period of dormant three months, my racquet was finally out of the cover. 
</p>
<p>
The internship season had driven me crazy. My entire summer was spent in front of the screen, either of TV or my laptop. Ahmedabad heat restricted my outings to a few. I was not able to get together with my friends until the very last day, that too with an excuse of giving a company's test together <i>(we didn't cheat)</i>.
</p>
<p>
After numerous tests, 1 waitlist and 3 shortlists, I finally made it to the other side (the sorted side). 
</p>
<p>
"Your game looks really rusty", said the newly joined fresher. My shots were going anywhere but within the lines; even launched one over the newly installed meshes. I was pissed with my game, but was extemely grateful about the opportunity to play after such a long time.
</p>

Made me realise that we, humans, take so many little things for granted.

{{< spoiler prompt = "Just finished watching Love ...">}}
<p>
Just finished watching Love, Death + Robots on Netflix. Here is the first tierlist I ever made in my life <i>(because why not ;D)</i>
</p>

{{< figure src="ldr.png" align="center" width="600">}}

Not the best use of your summer break time but I was not able to help it...

<h4>24/03, 1145 hrs</h4>

{{< spoiler prompt = "F1 is sick ...">}}
<p>
<b>F1 is sick !</b> Yeah, even I am now part of the bandwagon of mad people enjoying “superfast cars going around in circles”. To be honest, that was what I thought about the sport earlier and I guess everyone off the grid shares the same notion. But we (F1 followers) know that the reality speaks different.
</p>
<p>
I just spent 90 minutes of my Sunday morning watching the Australian GP and boy was it not worth it. Verstappen retiring in 3rd Lap, both the Mercedes’ crashing out, Sainz getting P1 after recovering from an apendicitis operation. . . Now, I am seriously looking forward to the next races.
</p>

I am just new to the game so haven’t really picked a side to be loyal to but I guess I will be rooting for Ferrari this season. I hate it when a single player dominates the sport (The Joker, iykyk)

<h4>23/02, 1950 hrs</h4>

{{< spoiler prompt = "Tomorrow is my Real Analysis midsem ...">}}
<p>
Tomorrow is my Real Analysis midsem which is 25% of my grade and am seriously under prepared. Probably not the best time to write on your blog but here I am. It seems that I am the worst when it comes to sorting one’s priorities.
</p>
<p>
Maybe, the reason of this is the fact that I have to study “real analysis”. I have a love-hate relationship with pure mathematics. I mean I seriously enjoyed the lectures we had (though I didn’t get half of what the prof was talking about) because they were mentally stimulating and fascinating at times, but I guess the abstract nature of the subject is not my thing.
</p>
<p>
<b>My bad.</b>
</p>
As of now, looks like the second cipher of the semester is on my way ;)
