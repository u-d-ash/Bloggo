### Hey there !
\
My name is Udit Jethva, a mathematics junior at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati.
\
\
I am a person of many interests but no real passion.
\
\
If you barge into my room at any arbitrary time, you may find me:

> * doomscrolling
> * playing music
> * coding 
> * doing some math
> * playing minesweeper, poker, geoguessr **[ðŸ”—](https://www.geoguessr.com/user/65ba3a6e4f4d24f118309af0)** or typeracer **[ðŸ”—](https://play.typeracer.com/)**
> * watching some sport or a movie
> * studying (rare)
> * sleeping 

If my room is locked, then I might be out for :

> * playing lawn tennis
> * quizzing 
> * a good movie

I don't fully know what I am doing with this blog . . .
