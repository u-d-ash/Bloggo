**Hey there !**

\
Welcome to my lounge. You can call it (μ_d) baba ki gufa ! It's an online space where I express myself freely... because I don't expect a lot of visitors like you. Now since you stumbled your way over here, how about you explore around. You know, press some buttons, click some links, read some stuff which I've put up; you may like it or maybe not (highly probable). I'll be elated if I discover you took your time here.

**a bit about me**


> * *6 ft. dark brown eyes. math.* (This wraps it up. ngl.)

Currently a math junior at IIT Guwahati. I find myself involved in a lot of activities at the same time which has led to one of my friends calling me ***the hobby whore***. Personally, I like this nickname a lot because it sounds like a cheap slang for a polymath.



> * I am okayish quizzer. Got the opportunity to represent my institute at 7th Inter IIT Cult Meet and will do the same at Nihilanth 2025. I have acted as a quizmaster on few occasions : [**Sci-Echo**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18j5jqIeLl_HXojF1OVJeD0hCZNyreKg_/view), [**Athleticism**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ka_bYX3NI_Cn69Zkg_E46LtM-1Rs1-NP/view?usp=sharing) & [A Few Drilling Bits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1egFhN-U2LEPA3UCdHq6XpVA8-7hgyXGG/view?usp=sharing).

> * I am an intermediate level tennis player; serves are my kryptonite. Federer is the GOAT, Nadal comes close second and the Joker is alright. I follow a lot of sports on a regular basis.

> * I purchased Procreate back in my first semester and I wonder when will it be worth. 

> * I enjoy watching great cinema & TV and am always looking for great book recs, so that I can purchase those paperbacks and never read them :(
